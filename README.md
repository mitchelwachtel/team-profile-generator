### Technology

### Usage
The application will run through a series of questions in your terminal. Answer them thoroughly in order for the team-profile.html file to be completed fully. The team-profile.html file will be created in the folder "dist" and will be set up to link to a style.css file also in the dist directory. You can rename this html file when moved to your repository, but don't forget to move the style.css file as well.
